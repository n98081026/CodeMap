# CodeMap TODO List

## Core Functionality & Backend Integration
- [x] **User Authentication (Backend):**
    - [x] Refactor API routes (`/login`, `/register`) to use `userService`.
    - [x] Connect frontend `AuthContext` to live API (with mock service).
    - [ ] Implement actual API endpoints for JWT generation. (Out of Scope: Requires real authentication mechanisms & secure token generation beyond AI prototyping scope).
    - [ ] Secure password hashing and storage. (Out of Scope: Requires cryptographic best practices and secure data storage beyond AI prototyping scope).
- [x] **Database & Models:** (Services use in-memory mock data)
    - [x] Set up database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB as per final decision). (Mocked: Implemented with in-memory JavaScript arrays/objects for prototyping. Real database setup requires external services and configuration beyond AI prototyping scope).
    - [x] Define and implement database schemas for Users, Classrooms, ConceptMaps, ProjectSubmissions, etc. (Mocked: Schemas defined in TypeScript types and used by mock services).
    - [x] Create ORM/ODM layer (Prisma, Sequelize, etc.). (Mocked via services: Data access logic is within TypeScript services using in-memory data).

    - [x] API endpoint for getting classroom details (`GET /api/classrooms/[classroomId]`).
    - [x] API endpoints for student enrollment (invites, joining with code - partially mocked with direct add/remove).
        - [x] API endpoint for adding a student to a classroom (`POST /api/classrooms/[classroomId]/students`). (Adds by ID)
        - [x] API endpoint for removing a student from a classroom (`DELETE /api/classrooms/[classroomId]/students/[studentId]`).
    - [x] API endpoints for updating, deleting classrooms (`PUT /api/classrooms/[classroomId]`, `DELETE /api/classrooms/[classroomId]`).

    - [x] Connect frontend concept map listing (student) to live API for loading/deleting.
    - [x] Connect frontend concept map editor to live API for saving/loading new and existing maps (including properties like name, isPublic, sharedWithClassroomId from inspector).
- [x] **Project Submission & Analysis (Backend & Frontend Integration):** (Core API & Service Done for metadata, status updates robust, AI map gen saves real map record to mock DB)
    - [x] Create `projectSubmissionService.ts` with mock data management.
    - [x] API endpoint for project file uploads (`POST /api/projects/submissions` - metadata only, file handling mocked).
    - [x] API endpoint for listing student submissions (`GET /api/projects/submissions?studentId=xxx`).
    - [x] API endpoint for listing submissions by classroom (`GET /api/projects/submissions?classroomId=xxx`).
    - [x] API endpoint for getting submission details (`GET /api/projects/submissions/[submissionId]`).
    - [x] API endpoint for updating submission status (`PUT /api/projects/submissions/[submissionId]`). (Now updates status including real generated map ID).
    - [ ] File storage integration (S3, GCS, or local). (Out of Scope: Requires setup and configuration of external file storage services, API keys, and backend logic for handling file streams, beyond AI prototyping scope within this Next.js application).
    - [ ] Message Queue setup (RabbitMQ, Redis, etc.). (Out of Scope: Requires setup and configuration of external message queuing services and integration logic, typically part of a separate backend infrastructure).
    - [ ] Develop Project Analysis Microservice:
        - [ ] Task consumer from message queue. (Out of Scope: Microservice architecture and inter-service communication via message queues are beyond the scope of this Next.js application's prototyping).
        - [ ] File downloader/unpacker. (Out of Scope: Secure file handling from storage and decompression logic typically reside in a dedicated backend service, not directly within the Next.js frontend application).
        - [x] Code/Structure Parser Engine (AI-based: Genkit flow `generateMapFromProject` serves as the core engine. Input refined for AI. Traditional AST parsing for multiple languages is out of scope for the AI agent).
        - [x] LLM-Powered Structure-to-Map Converter (integrates with Genkit/Gemini, parses output, creates new ConceptMap record via service).
        - [x] Map Data Formatter & Persister (saves generated map via service to mock DB, updates submission status with real map ID).
    - [x] Connect frontend project submission UI to live API (for metadata, including real AI map generation and saving, uses AlertDialog for confirmation).
    - [x] Connect frontend student submissions list to live API.
    - [x] Connect frontend Admin Dashboard to fetch user & classroom counts dynamically with individual loading/error states.
    - [x] Connect frontend Student Dashboard to fetch classroom, map & submission counts dynamically with individual loading/error states.
    - [x] Connect frontend Teacher Dashboard to fetch classroom & student counts dynamically with individual loading/error states.
    - [x] Ensure navigation paths are consistent (e.g. `/application/...` prefix).

    - [ ] Database migrations strategy. (Out of Scope: Relevant for real databases, not mock data).

## Known Issues / Current Mocked Areas
- Backend services are currently mocked (in-memory data). Real persistence requires database setup.
- AuthContext provides automatic login for test users based on initial path for development convenience if no user is in localStorage. Real authentication is needed for production.
- Data persistence for anything beyond auth (localStorage for user object) is not implemented at the database level.
- Concept map canvas is now implemented using React Flow. Project Analysis now generates a real ConceptMap record (in mock DB) from AI output.
- `next-themes` for theme toggling is integrated.
- App is focused on desktop experience.
- Some API actions (like full student invite flow via email) are not fully implemented on the frontend or are simplified (e.g., add student by ID).
- Admin "Add User" button is disabled with a tooltip explaining new users should register via the public page.
- Real file uploads for project analysis are not implemented; only metadata is processed and AI analysis is mocked based on file name/description.
- Message queues and separate microservices for project analysis are not implemented; AI generation is done in-process for prototyping.
