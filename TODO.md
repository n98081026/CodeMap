# CodeMap TODO List

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Manual Fixes Required for Core Functionality

The following files contain syntax/parsing errors that prevent ESLint and TypeScript from functioning correctly across the project. These **must be fixed manually by a developer** before automated linting, type checking, and further development can reliably proceed.

- **`src/ai/tools/project-analyzer-tool.ts`**:
  - **Issue**: Likely missing `return` statement at the end of the `analyzeJavaScriptAST` function. The function is asynchronous and promises a specific return type, but the control flow might not guarantee a return in all paths.
  - **Impact**: This is a very large file, and this error prevents its proper analysis, which may hide other issues within it.
- **`src/components/concept-map/genai-modals.tsx`**:
  - **Issue**: ESLint/Prettier reported "Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'DialogContent'".
  - **Impact**: JSX syntax error breaks rendering and linting for this file.
- **`src/components/tutorial/app-tutorial.tsx`**:
  - **Issue**: ESLint/Prettier reported "'}' expected".
  - **Impact**: Syntax error breaks this file.
- **`src/hooks/__tests__/useAdminDashboardMetrics.test.ts`**:
  - **Issue**: ESLint/Prettier reported "Unterminated regular expression literal".
  - **Impact**: Test file syntax error.
- **`src/hooks/__tests__/useStudentDashboardMetrics.test.ts`**:
  - **Issue**: ESLint/Prettier reported "Unterminated regular expression literal".
  - **Impact**: Test file syntax error.
- **`src/hooks/__tests__/useTeacherDashboardMetrics.test.ts`**:
  - **Issue**: ESLint/Prettier reported "Unterminated regular expression literal".
  - **Impact**: Test file syntax error.

**Action Required:** A developer needs to manually inspect these files, correct the syntax errors, and ensure they are parsable.

## Known Issues / Current State

- Backend services fully migrated to Supabase.
- AuthContext migrated to Supabase Auth.
- Concept map canvas is React Flow, editor logic highly modularized.
- Numerous editor UX and AI-powered enhancements added.
- **`projectStructureAnalyzerTool` now processes real file content from Supabase Storage, including from ZIP archives. It performs AST analysis for JS/TS/Python, extracts metadata from common manifest files, identifies a wide range of file types, generates directory structure summaries, and uses LLM for summarizing code elements and generic config files. Security limits for file sizes and counts are in place.** (Reflects recent major updates)
  - **Fixed:** The Genkit tool's declared `outputSchema` in `project-analyzer-tool.ts` has been updated to match the richer structure returned by its implementation.
- Supabase client library installed and configured.
- API routes rely on Supabase-backed services.
- Client-side file upload for project analysis uploads to Supabase Storage.
- Admin User Management and Profile Page connected to Supabase.
- Dashboard counts fetched from Supabase-backed APIs.
- Classroom, Concept Map, and Student Submissions list connected to Supabase.
- Application is highly modular.
- Core in-editor AI features implemented with visual cues.
- View-only mode for concept map editor implemented.
- Developer role switcher added.
- Interactive Tutorial system implemented with React Joyride for key user flows (Dashboard, Project Upload, Editor Basics, Extract Concepts AI tool). (UI triggers added, styling applied, manual testing guide created).
  - **Fixed:** Tutorial `overlayColor` in `AppTutorial.tsx` now correctly uses comma-separated HSL values via a new `--background-values` CSS variable defined in `globals.css`.

The main remaining area for full Supabase connection is:

- Further enhancing `projectStructureAnalyzerTool` for deeper semantic understanding beyond current AST/structural analysis and LLM summarization of elements/generic files (marked as user-defined/pending advanced feature).
- Potentially enhancing real-time features with Supabase Realtime (currently out of scope).
- Thorough testing (manual and automated) and deployment preparations.

## Project Setup & DX Enhancements (Jules & User)

- [ ] **Manual User Tasks (Local Environment):**
  - **Action:** In your local environment, please perform the following steps in order and commit the changes:
    1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install` (or `yarn install`). This is crucial as Jules encountered issues running this in the sandbox.
    2. Run the initial Prettier formatting: `npm run format`. This includes:
       - The initial full-project format.
       - Specifically `src/app/application/student/dashboard/page.tsx`.
       - The entire `src/components/` directory.
       - Other directories like `src/app/application/student/projects/` and `src/app/application/teacher/` that Jules skipped due to sandbox limits.
    3. Run ESLint autofix: `npm run lint:fix`. This should be run _after_ Prettier has formatted the codebase.
    4. Run TypeScript type check: `npm run typecheck` (i.e., `tsc --noEmit`). Review and fix any reported type errors.
  - **Note for Jules:** Once these steps are done and changes are committed, Jules can proceed with reviewing any remaining ESLint issues or other planned tasks.

- [x] **ESLint & Prettier Configuration & Initial Setup (Jules - Partially Blocked by User for full format/lint run):**
  - [x] Create `.prettierrc.json` with recommended settings.
  - [x] Create `.prettierignore` (added `*.py`, ensured standard ignores).
  - [x] Update `package.json` with necessary ESLint & Prettier devDependencies and quality-related scripts.
  - [x] Refactor `eslint.config.js` to a standard Flat Config format, integrating Next.js and Prettier rules.
  - [x] Delete a-conflicting `.eslintrc.json`.
  - [x] Create `.eslintignore`.
  - [x] Partially formatted project using Prettier (e.g., `src/ai/`, parts of `src/app/`, `src/hooks/`). Fixed syntax errors in `src/ai/tools/project-analyzer-tool.ts`.
  - [ ] **(User Action Required in Local Env - see above)** Run `npm run format` (Prettier) for remaining large directories / full project.
  - [ ] **(User Action Required in Local Env - see above)** Run `npm run lint:fix` (ESLint) to check and autofix linting issues based on the new configuration.
  - [ ] Review any outstanding ESLint errors/warnings after `lint:fix`. (Jules will do this after user actions)

- [ ] **Project Structure Optimization (Jules - Test File Organization Blocked by User):**
  - [x] **Dashboard Pages De-duplication (Admin, Student, Teacher):**
    - [x] Identified duplicate dashboard content between `src/app/(app)/[role]/dashboard/page.tsx` and `src/app/application/[role]/dashboard/page.tsx`.
    - [x] Created shared view components: `src/components/dashboard/admin/AdminDashboardView.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/student/StudentDashboardView.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/teacher/TeacherDashboardView.tsx`.
    - [x] Refactored all six dashboard `page.tsx` files to use these shared view components, effectively de-duplicating UI and core logic.
  - [ ] **Test Files Organization (User Action Required First):**
    - **Step 1 (User Action Required in Local Env):** Create the following `__tests__` directories:
      - `src/app/(app)/__tests__/`
      - `src/app/(app)/examples/__tests__/`
      - `src/components/concept-map/__tests__/`
      - `src/components/layout/__tests__/`
      - `src/contexts/__tests__/`
      - `src/hooks/__tests__/`
      - `src/lib/__tests__/`
      - `src/services/classrooms/__tests__/`
      - `src/stores/__tests__/`
      - `src/ai/tools/__tests__/`
    - **Step 2 (Jules - Blocked by Step 1):** Move existing test files to their respective new `__tests__` directory. Planned moves:
      - `src/app/(app)/layout.test.tsx` -> `src/app/(app)/__tests__/layout.test.tsx`
      - `src/app/(app)/examples/page.test.tsx` -> `src/app/(app)/examples/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
      - `src/components/concept-map/AIStagingToolbar.test.tsx` -> `src/components/concept-map/__tests__/AIStagingToolbar.test.tsx`
      - `src/components/concept-map/GhostPreviewToolbar.test.tsx` -> `src/components/concept-map/__tests__/GhostPreviewToolbar.test.tsx`
      - `src/components/concept-map/ai-suggestion-panel.test.tsx` -> `src/components/concept-map/__tests__/ai-suggestion-panel.test.tsx`
      - `src/components/concept-map/editor-toolbar.test.tsx` -> `src/components/concept-map/__tests__/editor-toolbar.test.tsx`
      - `src/components/layout/sidebar-nav.test.tsx` -> `src/components/layout/__tests__/sidebar-nav.test.tsx`
      - `src/contexts/auth-context.test.tsx` -> `src/contexts/__tests__/auth-context.test.tsx`
      - `src/hooks/useConceptMapAITools.test.ts` -> `src/hooks/__tests__/useConceptMapAITools.test.ts`
      - `src/hooks/useConceptMapDataManager.test.ts` -> `src/hooks/__tests__/useConceptMapDataManager.test.ts`
      - `src/lib/dagreLayoutUtility.test.ts` -> `src/lib/__tests__/dagreLayoutUtility.test.ts`
      - `src/lib/layout-utils.test.ts` -> `src/lib/__tests__/layout-utils.test.ts`
      - `src/services/classrooms/classroomService.test.ts` -> `src/services/classrooms/__tests__/classroomService.test.ts`
      - `src/stores/concept-map-store.test.ts` -> `src/stores/__tests__/concept-map-store.test.ts`
      - `src/ai/tools/project-analyzer-tool.test.ts` -> `src/ai/tools/__tests__/project-analyzer-tool.test.ts`
    - **Step 3 (Jules - Blocked by Step 1 & 2):** Verify/Update `vitest.config.ts` to correctly find tests in new locations and ensure tests still pass.

## Ongoing: AI Interaction Layer Enhancements & Hook Refactoring (Revised after file restore)

- [ ] **Enhance `callAIWithStandardFeedback` (NEEDS DEVELOPER RE-IMPLEMENTATION & VERIFICATION):**
  - [ ] Implement `options.onSuccess?: (output: O, input: I) => void` in function signature and logic.
    - _Purpose_: Allow specific side effects post-AI success, before default toast.
  - [ ] Implement `options.onError?: (error: unknown, input: I) => boolean | void` in function signature and logic.
    - _Purpose_: Enable custom error handling; can suppress default error toast if it returns `true`.
  - [ ] Implement refined `userFriendlyMessage` generation in `catch` block to better use `error.details` or other structured error info from Genkit.
  - [x] JSDoc for `callAIWithStandardFeedback` has been updated to describe these intended `onSuccess` and `onError` options. (Jules - Done)

- [ ] **Refactor `useConceptMapAITools.ts` (NEEDS DEVELOPER REVIEW & IMPLEMENTATION):**
  - [ ] **Extract AI success handlers**: After `onSuccess` is implemented in `callAIWithStandardFeedback`, refactor ALL `handle...` functions (including Q&A handlers) to move their success logic into this callback.
    - _Goal_: Reduce nesting and length of `handle...` functions.
  - [ ] **Isolate simple AI flow calls**: Review handlers that primarily display a toast on success; ensure they leverage `callAIWithStandardFeedback`'s `successDescription` effectively.
  - [ ] **Review and add/update comments**: Add more comments for complex sections throughout the hook.
  - [ ] **Thoroughly review `useCallback` dependencies**: **CRITICAL - NEEDS DEVELOPER REVIEW & ADJUSTMENT WITH LOCAL LINTER/TESTING.** Ensure all `useCallback` hooks have correct and exhaustive dependencies.

- [ ] **Update relevant AI tool invocation points (NEEDS DEVELOPER IMPLEMENTATION):**
  - This task is dependent on the above refactoring.

- [ ] **Documentation**:
  - [x] JSDoc for `callAIWithStandardFeedback` options updated. (Jules - Done)
  - [ ] Broader documentation for the hook, its patterns, and specific AI handler logic is still pending.
