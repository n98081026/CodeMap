Subject: [PATCH 23/27] Feat: Add C# project simulation to
 projectStructureAnalyzerTool

This commit further enhances the mocking capabilities of `projectStructureAnalyzerTool.ts` by adding a simulation for C# (ASP.NET Core) projects.

Key changes to `projectStructureAnalyzerTool.ts`:
- Defined conceptual file content for a sample C# / ASP.NET Core Web API project (including `.csproj`, `Program.cs`, `appsettings.json`, controllers, models, services, and `README.md`).
- Implemented basic simulated "parsing" for these conceptual C# project files:
    - Extracts H1 from `README.md`.
    - Parses `.csproj` for NuGet package dependencies.
    - Parses `appsettings.json` for top-level configuration keys.
    - Extracts namespaces, using directives, public class/interface/enum names, public method names, and public property names from `.cs` files using regex.
- Introduced a new hint, `_USE_SIMULATED_FS_CSHARP_PROJECT_`, which triggers this C# project simulation.
- When activated, I generate a `ProjectAnalysisOutput` with C#-specific details, including:
    - `inferredLanguagesFrameworks` (C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core if detected).
    - NuGet dependencies.
    - `keyFiles` for C# source files with extracted symbols.
    - Simulated `directoryStructureSummary` reflecting namespaces/folders.
- Hint priorities were adjusted to correctly incorporate this new simulation path.

The `TODO.md` file has been updated to reflect these new C# simulation capabilities of the project analyzer. This provides more diverse and detailed mock data for testing AI flows.
