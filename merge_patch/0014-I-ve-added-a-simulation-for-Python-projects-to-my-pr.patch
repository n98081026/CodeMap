Subject: [PATCH 14/27] I've added a simulation for Python projects to my
 project structure analysis capabilities.

Here's what this means for you:
- I can now conceptually understand a sample Python project, including `.py` files, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md`.
- I can perform a basic simulated "parsing" of these conceptual Python files. This means I can:
    - Extract the main heading from a `README.md`.
    - Identify dependencies from a `requirements.txt`.
    - Extract class names, top-level function names, and import statements from `.py` files.
- There's a new way to trigger this Python project simulation.
- When activated, I will generate an analysis with Python-specific details, including:
    - Inferred languages and frameworks (Python, FastAPI if detected).
    - Dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    - Key Python files with extracted symbols.
    - A simulated directory structure summary.
- I've adjusted my internal priorities to correctly incorporate this new simulation.

I've also updated my internal notes to reflect these new Python simulation capabilities. This helps me generate more diverse and detailed mock data for testing how I approach different coding scenarios.
