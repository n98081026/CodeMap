Subject: [PATCH 17/27] Feat: Implement Genkit flow for AI Tidy-Up Selection

This commit introduces the backend Genkit AI flow (`aiTidyUpSelectionFlow`) for the "AI Tidy-Up / Smart Alignment" feature.

Key changes:
- Created `src/ai/flows/ai-tidy-up-selection.ts`:
    - Defines input schemas (`AiTidyUpSelectionInputSchema`, `NodeLayoutInfoSchema`) for receiving an array of selected nodes with their geometric properties and optional text/type.
    - Defines output schemas (`AiTidyUpSelectionOutputSchema`, `NodeNewPositionSchema`) for returning new (x, y) positions for these nodes.
    - Implements `aiTidyUpSelectionPrompt` which instructs me to rearrange nodes based on principles of alignment, distribution, overlap reduction, and proximity.
    - The `aiTidyUpSelectionFlow` itself includes robust fallback logic: if my output is invalid or fewer than two nodes are provided, it returns the original node positions to prevent map disruption.
- Updated `src/ai/flows/index.ts`:
    - Exported `aiTidyUpSelectionFlow` and its associated types, making it available for integration into the application logic.

This flow provides my capability to suggest layout improvements for a selection of concept map nodes. The UI integration (toolbar button, calling this flow, and applying results) will be handled in subsequent steps.
No TODO.md changes in this specific commit as it's purely the AI flow backend.
